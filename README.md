The section of chapter 1 that spoke the most to me has to be the first section about taking responsibility for code. This speaks to me, because often in my programming I am either stubborn in admitting that there is something flawed with my code, or more often, I have issue in finding my errors in my code, ie debugging. While I do have trouble with these things, I hope that I will be able to overcome them, and be an effecient programmer in the future.
